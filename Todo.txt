Important todos:

1. no writes to stdout directly (important for testing but also other purposes e.g. setting verbosity levels). Use a wrapper object.
2. clean termination with proper return codes (no exits!!)
3. increase test-coverage (especially all uncovered actions in cli.rb and the error conditions)
4. implement actions as Action_objects that can be passed as visitors along the host-tree
5. add pre/post_action script hooks
