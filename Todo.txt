Important todos:

1. no writes to stdout directly (important for testing but also other purposes e.g. setting verbosity levels). Use a wrapper object.
2. clean termination with proper return codes (no exits!!). Use exceptions to signal errors to the cli.rb, which can then return a errorcode.
3. wrap ssh calls
4. increase test-coverage (especially all uncovered actions in cli.rb and the error conditions)
5. implement actions as Action_objects that can be passed as visitors along the host-tree
6. add pre/post_action script hooks
